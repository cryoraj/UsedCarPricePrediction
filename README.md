# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

Repository: [cryoraj/UsedCarPricePrediction](https://github.com/cryoraj/UsedCarPricePrediction)

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes a large dataset of used vehicles to identify the key drivers of resale price and build predictive models for dealership stakeholders.  
The goal is to fine-tune inventory strategy and pricing using **data-driven insights**.

## Dataset summary
---
- This dataset contains listings for used vehicles and is structured to support price prediction and resale-value analysis. The target variable is price (sale price), and the table includes both numeric and categorical features that capture vehicle attributes, condition, and location.

  - Key features
  - year — model year (used to derive vehicle age)
  - price — sale price (target)
  - odometer / mileage — total miles driven (numeric)
  - manufacturer — vehicle make (e.g., Toyota, Ford)
  - model / type — model name and vehicle type (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck)
  - condition — seller-reported condition (ordinal: poor → like new)
  - cylinders — engine cylinder count (numeric/ordinal)
  - fuel — fuel type (gas, diesel, hybrid, electric)
  - transmission — transmission type (automatic, manual)
  - drive — drivetrain (FWD, RWD, AWD)
  - state / location — geographic location of the listing
  - additional fields — may include color, title status, VIN presence, posting date, and seller type

- The dataset requires standard preprocessing: derive age from year, handle missing values and outliers, encode categorical variables (one‑hot or ordinal where appropriate), and consider log-transforming price for modeling stability.
- Primary predictors observed: age, mileage, condition, and manufacturer — these drive most of the variance in resale price and are emphasized in the analysis.

## 📊 Summary of Findings
- **Best-performing model:** XGBoost, with the lowest error (RMSE ≈ 4,746, MAE ≈ 2,828).  
- **Key predictors of price:**
  - **Age:** Steep depreciation in the first 5–7 years, then flattens.  
  - **Mileage:** Strong negative effect, especially in the first 50k miles.  
  - **Condition:** Step-wise premiums; “good” → “excellent” → “like new.”  
  - **Brand:** Luxury brands (BMW, Mercedes, Lexus) retain higher value; mass-market brands (Toyota, Honda, Ford) show strong resale reliability.  
- **Business impact:**  
  - Prioritize newer, low-mileage vehicles.  
  - Invest in reconditioning when uplift > cost.  
  - Adjust inventory mix by region and vehicle type (SUVs/trucks command higher resale).

## 🛠 Dealer-Facing Recommendations

- **Acquisition Strategy:**  
  - Prioritize newer, low-mileage vehicles.  
  - Focus on brands with strong resale premiums.  

- **Pricing Strategy:**  
  - Use mileage and age tiers to set discounts.  
  - Apply condition premiums consistently to justify reconditioning costs.  

- **Inventory Mix:**  
  - Stock more SUVs and trucks (higher average resale).  
  - Adjust mix by region (e.g., trucks in Texas, hybrids in California).

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

To assess model performance, we used two standard regression metrics:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):**  
  Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual prices.  
  - Penalizes larger errors more heavily.  
  - Lower RMSE indicates better overall accuracy.  

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):**  
  Measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual prices.  
  - Easier to interpret (average dollar error).  
  - Less sensitive to outliers compared to RMSE.  

### Why These Metrics?
- **RMSE** highlights how well the model handles large deviations (important for luxury or high-value vehicles).  
- **MAE** provides a straightforward measure of the average prediction error in dollars, making it intuitive for dealership stakeholders.

## 📈 Model Comparison

| Model              | RMSE (Price, $) | MAE (Price, $) |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **XGBoost**        | **4,746.60**    | **2,828.19**   |
| GradientBoosting   | 5,809.49        | 3,550.30       |
| Linear Regression  | 6,348.67        | 3,982.93       |
| Ridge (alpha=10)   | 6,370.66        | 3,986.02       |
| Lasso (alpha=0.001)| 6,461.85        | 4,071.03       |

✅ **XGBoost is the most accurate**, reducing pricing error by ~$1,500 compared to linear models.

✅ **Interpretation:**  
- XGBoost achieves the lowest RMSE and MAE, meaning it consistently predicts prices with the smallest error margin.  
- Gradient Boosting performs reasonably well but with ~20% higher error.  
- Linear, Ridge, and Lasso models are less effective at capturing non-linear depreciation and brand effects.
