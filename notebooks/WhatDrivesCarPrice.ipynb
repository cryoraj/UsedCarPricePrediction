    "In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car."

    "Turn the business question — “what drives the price of a used car?” — into a supervised learning and explanatory-data-analysis problem: build and validate a predictive regression model that estimates a car’s sale price from its attributes (make, model, year, mileage, trim, fuel/engine type, transmission, location, condition, etc.), and use interpretable model-analysis (feature importance, partial dependence, SHAP) and rigorous EDA to identify the causal / correlational drivers of price. \n",

    "**Approach:** perform data cleaning (missing-data treatment, outlier detection), feature engineering (age, mileage-per-year, market-region indicators), categorical encoding, and exploratory analysis; train several regression models (linear models with regularization, tree-based models like Random Forest / XGBoost); evaluate with cross-validated metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²) and robustness checks.\n",
